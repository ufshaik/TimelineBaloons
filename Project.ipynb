    "The client wanted a solution to a visual problem, \"Given a dataset consisting of four columns, namely, Name, Start Date, End Date, and Intensity; I want a visual that is easy to look at and yet conveys the information it has to. The graph should be able to show the events with duration and intensity togather. The existing visuals are too big to look at, so I need something simple.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "By existing visuals, the client was referring to the well known Gantt Chart. A lot of interaction took place between the client and me; the client was most satisfied with the Timeline Balloons Animated Variations. When the above mentioned visual was shown, the least amount of explanation was required, and the client was quickly able to decode the information. "

    "The California Forest Fires are incidents recorded by The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Hence each event corresponds to an event in time series domain and can be qualified as a time-series event dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset being used consists of events starting from 2000 to 2017. The records are more accurate with the progression of each year, meaning that the year 2000 dataset has a lot of corrupt and missing values for some columns compared to the years after. One of the reasons for this might be technological advancement or better rules enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific units allocated for the area monitoring did the recording of the events, these units were responsible for maintaining a record consisting of the name of the fire, start and end dates of the fire, the acres of land burned, and the cause for the fire.\n",

    "Even the animation variation, although very helpful for smaller datasets would prove to be useless if plugged with a larger dataset due to a lot of animation states present in the same multiple.\n",

    "But violating two of the principles of muzner where hue was applied to Intensity instead of saturation, and Saturation was applied to x axis duration instead of hue provided to be useful. Also constructing multiple marks on the x axis yielded in fruitful results.\n",

    "In regards to suggestion on Muzner's methodology, sometimes its hard decide the why, after you have constructed the idioms. Also, its very confusing the way she uses ordinal and quantitative attributes. Which often ends up in a confusion unless referred to the idioms Key, Attribute pair for clarification.\n",
